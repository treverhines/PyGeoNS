# Smoothing Synthetic Cascadia Data

# This script demonstrates how to use pygeons to spatially smooth GPS
# data.

# convert the csv file to and HDF5 file. The first and second
# positional arguments are the file name and file type respectively.
# Possible file types are csv, pbo_csv, and pbo_pos
pygeons-toh5 synthetic.csv csv -o work/synthetic.h5

# spatial cutoff frequency in meters^-1. The underlying signal in the
# synthetic data has a frequency of 2.5e-6.  If we pick a cutoff
# frequency which is just above the frequency of the signals then the
# underlying signal will be kept in tact.
