# This script demonstrates using the PyGeoNS executables to calculate
# strain from four GPS time series, which are saved in data.csv.

# Define the parameters describing the prior Gaussian processes used
# to temporally smooth and differentiate displacements and then
# spatially smooth and differentiate velocities.
DISP_CLS=0.1   # Characteristic time scale of the prior Gaussian
               # process for displacements. This is in years.
DISP_STD=5.0   # Standard deviation of the prior Gaussian process for
               # displacements. This is in mm.
DISP_ORDER=1   # Order of the polynomial null space. Setting this to 1
               # means that constant and linear trends in the data
               # will not be damped out in the smoothed solution.

VEL_CLS=200.0  # Characteristic length scale of the prior Gaussian
               # process for velocities. This is in kilometers.
VEL_STD=100.0  # Standard deviation of the prior Gaussian process for
               # velocities. This is in mm/yr.
VEL_ORDER=1    # Order of the polynomial null space. Setting this to 1
               # means that constant and linear trends in the data
               # will not be damped out in the smoothed solution.
