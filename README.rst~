PyGeoNS (Python-based Geodetic Network Strain software)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NOTE: The interface for PyGeoNS is now fairly stable, but the
documentation still needs to be updated. Demonstrations can be found
in the ``demo`` directory.

PyGeoNS (pronounced like the bird) is a suite of command line
functions that are used to identify transient strain in GNSS data.
This analysis is performed in a Bayesian framework, using Gaussian
process regression, and thus the results have well-quantified and
meaningful uncertainties. Gaussian process regression is not robust
against outliers, which is a common defect in GNSS data. Thus, PyGeoNS
provides a function for detecting outliers as a pre-processing step.
The outlier detection algorithm flags data which are spatially or
temporally anomalous. PyGeoNS also provides a function for
interactively removing data defects. Lastly, PyGeoNS provides
functions to interactively view the data and results.

Limitations
===========
Gaussian process regression requires solving a system of equations
where the number of unknowns is equal to the number of observations.
Assuming that a high-end desktop computer is being used, this means
that datasets will be limited to several dozen stations and a few
years of daily observations. This limitation can be alleviated to some
extent by using a compact prior covariance function (see below).

PyGeoNS calculates strain on a transverse-mercator projection. It is
assumed that the stations cover a sufficiently small area that such a
projection is appropriate. 

Installation
============
PyGeoNS requires the standard scientific python packages, which can be 
found in the base Anaconda python installation 
(http://www.continuum.io/downloads). Additionally, PyGeoNS requires 
that the RBF package be installed 
(http://www.github.com/treverhines/RBF). Once these dependencies are 
satisfied, this package can be downloaded and installed with the 
following commands

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone http://www.github.com/treverhines/PyGeoNS.git
  $ cd PyGeoNS 
  $ python setup.py install

Demonstration
=============
This demonstration walks through the script ``demo/demo2/run.sh``,
which estimates transient strain resulting from a slow slip event in
Washington. First, navigate to the directory ``demo/demo2``. 

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd demo/demo2

You will find ``urls.txt`` which contains urls pointing to the GNSS
data that we will use. Lets download the data and save it in the
directory ``work/csv``

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkdir -p work/csv
  $ for i in `cat urls.txt`
      do
      wget -P 'work/csv' $i
      done
   
Next we merge each data file into one data file that PyGeoNS can read.
This just requires concatenating the files with a ``***`` delimiter.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sed -s '$a***' work/csv/* | sed '$d' > work/data.csv

Now we are ready to use PyGeoNS. We convert the csv file to an HDF5
file, which is more efficient for i/o.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pygeons toh5 'work/data.csv' \
                 --file-type 'pbocsv' 

This will generate a file ``work/data.h5``. We can now interactively
view the data file with

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pygeons vector-view 'work/data.h5' \
                        --no-show-vertical \
                        -v

The '-v' flag increased the verbosity and caused instructions for the
interactive viewer to be printed to the screen. Use the arrows to view
different stations and times. To keep this demonstration tractible, we
crop the dataset down so that is only spans two years.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pygeons crop 'work/data.h5' \
                 --start-date '2015-05-01' \
                 --stop-date '2017-05-01'

This produces the file ``work/data.crop.h5``. Next we automatically
identify and remove outliers in the dataset with the command ``pygeons
autoclean``. There are several arguments to this function that should
be tweaked, but we will just use the defaults for now.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pygeons autoclean 'work/data.crop.h5' -vv

This function will take a few minutes to run. The verbosity has been
increased so that we can see its progress. We can compare the dataset
before and after cleaning by using ``pygeons vector-view`` again.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pygeons vector-view 'work/data.crop.h5' 'work/data.crop.autoclean.h5' \
                        --no-show-vertical 

We now estimate transient strain from the cleaned GNSS data. Since
PyGeoNS performs Bayesian analysis, we must specify a prior for
transient displacements and a noise model. Our prior is a Gaussian
process with temporal covariance described by a Wendland function and
spatial covariance described by a squared exponential. We also specify
three hyperparameters for the prior. The first describes the standard
deviation of our prior (in mm), the second is a time-scale parameter
(in yr), and the third is a length-scale parameter (in km). The noise
in our data consists of white noise (which we do not need to specify)
and a linear trend that is unique for each station. This linear trend
is secular tectonic deformation, which we are not interested in for
this demonstration. By default, strains will be estimated at the
locations of each station in the dataset and for each day in the
dataset. The computation time can be decreased by specifying a smaller
range of times and positions to output at. Use the ``--start-date``
and ``--end-date`` arguments to set the range of output times. Use the
``--positions`` or ``--positions-file`` to set the output positions.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pygeons strain 'work/data.crop.autoclean.h5' \
                   --network-prior-model 'spwen12-se' \
                   --network-prior-params 1.0 0.1 100.0 \
                   --station-noise-model 'linear' \
                   --start-date '2015-10-01' \
                   --stop-date '2016-04-01' \
                   -vv

This returns two files, ``work/data.crop.autoclean.strain.dudx.h5``
and ``work/data.crop.autoclean.strain.dudy.h5``, which are the
velocity gradients along the x (east) direction and the y (north)
direction, respectively. Use the ``--no-rate`` flag to return
displacement gradients rather than the velocity gradients. The
deformation gradients can be viewed with ``pygeons vector-view``. We
can also use the deformation gradients to view strain with ``pygeons
strain-view``.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pygeons strain-view 'work/data.crop.autoclean.strain.dudx.h5' \
                        'work/data.crop.autoclean.strain.dudy.h5' \
                        --scale 20000.0 \
                        --key-magnitude 1.0 \
                        --key-position 0.15 0.85 \
                        -vv

This will open up an interactive viewer for the estimated strain
rates. The glyphs show the normal strain rates for all azimuths.
Orange indicates compression and blue indicates extension. 

.. figure:: demo/demo2/figures/map_view.png

  Map view of strain rates during a slow slip event. The glyphs show
  the normal strain rates along each azimuth, where orange indicates
  compression and blue indicates extension. The shaded region
  indicates the 68% confidence interval in the normal strain rates.

.. figure:: demo/demo2/figures/time_series_view.png

  Time series for each component of the strain rate tensor at the 
  station indicated by the black dot. The shaded region indicates the 
  68% confidence interval. 

The deformation gradients (or any of the intermediary HDF5 files) can
be output to a user-friendly csv file format with the command
``pygeons totext``. The name of the output file (minus the extension)
is specified with the ``--output-stem`` argument

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pygeons totext 'work/data.crop.autoclean.strain.dudx.h5' \
                   --output-stem 'dudx'
  $ pygeons totext 'work/data.crop.autoclean.strain.dudy.h5' \
                   --output-stem 'dudy'

That completes the demonstration. More detailed information about
PyGeoNS can be found below or by calling each PyGeoNS subcommand with
the `-h` flag.


Subcommands
===========
PyGeoNS contains the following subcommands. Call these functions with
a '-h' flag to see more information.

* ``pygeons toh5`` : Convert data from a text file to an HDF5 file.
* ``pygeons totext`` : Convert data from an HDF5 file to a text file.
* ``pygeons info`` : Display metadata for an HDF5 data file.
* ``pygeons vector-view`` : Interactively view an HDF5 data file or
  multiple data files.
* ``pygeons strain-view`` : Interactively view strain from the
  deformation gradient files, which are the HDF5 files returned by
  ``pygeons strain``.
* ``pygeons reml`` : Estimate prior and noise hyperparameters with the
  restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method.
* ``pygeons strain`` : Estimate transient strain from an HDF5 file of
  displacements. 
* ``pygeons clean`` : Interactively remove jumps and outliers in an
  HDF5 data file. 
* ``pygeons autoclean`` : Automatically remove outliers in an HDF5
  file of displacements.
* ``pygeons crop`` : Spatially and temporally crops an HDF5 data file.
* ``pygeons merge`` : Combine HDF5 data files.

HDF5 Data Format
================
PyGeoNS subcommands mostly read from and write to HDF5 data files. An
HDF5 file can be read using, for example, the h5py package in python.
Each HDF5 file contain the following entries

* ``time`` : Array of unique integers with shape (Nt,). Integer values 
  of modified Julian dates.
* ``id`` : Array of unique strings with shape (Nx,). 4-character IDs 
  for each station.
* ``longitude``, ``latitude`` : Array of floats with shape (Nx,). 
  Coordinates for each station.
* ``east``, ``north``, ``vertical`` : Array of floats with shape 
  (Nt,Nx). These are the data components. The units should be in terms 
  of meters and days and should be consistent with the values 
  specified for ``space_exponent`` and ``time_exponent``. For example, 
  if ``time_exponent`` is -1 and ``space_exponent`` is 1 then the units 
  should be in meters per day. If data is missing for a particular 
  time and station then it should be set to nan.
* ``east_std_dev``, ``north_std_dev``, ``vertical_std_dev`` : Array of 
  floats with shape (Nt,Nx). One standard deviation uncertainties for 
  each component of the data.  The units should be the same as those 
  used for the data components. If data is missing for a particular 
  time and station then it should be set to inf.
* ``time_exponent`` : Integer. This indicates the power of the time 
  units for the data. -1 indicates that the data is a rate, -2 indicates 
  an acceleration, etc.
* ``space_exponent`` : Integer. Indicates the power of the spatial 
  units for the data.


Text Data Format
================

An HDF5 file can be created from a text file of GNSS data with
``pygeons toh5``. This function is currently able to read three text
file formats: PBO csv files, PBO pos files, and a csv file format
designed for PyGeoNS. To use ``pygeons toh5``, the text files for each
station must be concatenated into a single file with delimiter
``***``. For example, if the data files are in the current directory
and contain a ``.csv`` extension then they can be concatenated with
the following sed incantation

.. code-block::

  $ sed -s '$a***' *.csv | sed '$d' > data.csv 

Next, call ``pygeons toh5`` with the new file name and specify the
file type with ``--file-type``. The file type can be ``csv``,
``pbocsv``, or ``pbopos``.

See www.unavco.org for information on the PBO data file formats. An
example of each file format is provided below.

PyGeoNS CSV
-----------
The PyGeoNS CSV file only contains information that PyGeoNS uses, 
making it unambigous which fields can influence the results. For 
example, there is no reference frame information in the PyGeoNS csv 
format because PyGeoNS does not ever use that information.
